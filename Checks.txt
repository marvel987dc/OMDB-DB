        if(!title ) res.status(400).json({error: 'No title parameter'});

In this line, I wrote an if condiitonal to check if  the title is not equal to 
any title in the API it will display and status 400 that means is a bad request, 
so, if the user try to prompt something that is no in the server it just marked
 it as an error, displaying the string (No title parameter)


         res.status(201).json(movie)
This  line is to send the response back to the client with a status code 
of 201, which means that the request was succesully created on the server


        res.status(500).send({ error: "An error occurred while fetching favorites." });
Here I rote inside the cath the res/status(500) in order to know when a error occurs inside the 'try' 
sending a message to the user saying "An error occurred while fetching favorites." 


        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Movie soft deleted successfully'});
The status 200 in this case indicates that the soft delete has been successfully made 
in the database, meaning that the information was successfully updated.
